ES6 support
-----------

Duktape (the JavaScript engine used by `sjs`) currently implements
`a subset of ES6 features <http://duktape.org/guide.html#es6features>`_.

`sjs` expands on this by provising `this ES6 shim <https://github.com/paulmillr/es6-shim/#es6-shim>`_ builtin.

.. note::
    No shim for `Promise` objects is currently provided.
